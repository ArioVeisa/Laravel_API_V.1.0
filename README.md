|--------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| GET    | /api/v1/resources   | Get a list of all resources          | No             |

| DELETE | /api/v1/resource/{id} | Delete a specific resource by ID   | Yes            |

### Authentication

This API uses token-based authentication via Laravel Sanctum. To access secured endpoints, the user needs to authenticate and include the token in the request headers:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

For more information on Sanctum, visit the [official documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/sanctum).

## Testing

```bash
php artisan test
```

You can also add more specific tests by placing them in the `tests/` directory.
